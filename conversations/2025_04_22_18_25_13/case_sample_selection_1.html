        <h4> The pie chart illustrates the distribution of selected and unselected samples. There are 4073 selected samples out of a total of 5543 samples, making up 73.48% of the dataset. This visualization helps to clearly understand the proportion of samples in each category.</h4>
        <h4> The selection is based on the logic expression you provided:    A , where each letter represents an individual clause as follows: {'A': '("Agent is in |FLUOROURACIL,LEUCOVORIN,OXALIPLATIN|")'}</h4>
